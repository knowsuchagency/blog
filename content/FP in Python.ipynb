    "I'm not a mathematician; I'm a working stiff without a formal math background.\n",

    "can actually provide business value, by helping us write more correct, robust, easy-to-test and understand code.\n",

    "I should also note that it's rarely been my experience in learning something new and complicated that there is any one\n",

    "from a variety of sources on the subject -- some of which I'll link to at the end.\n",

    "So long as you have a basic grasp of sets and functions, you should be able to follow along."
