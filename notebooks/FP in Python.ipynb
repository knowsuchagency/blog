    "is value in these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is not to write a guide that is comprehensive or perfect. \n",
    "I'm not a mathematician; I'm a working stiff without a formal math background.\n",
    "I find myself attracted to these concepts because I think using them\n",
    "can actually provide business value, by helping us write more correct, robust, easy-to-test and understand code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also note that it's rarely been my experience in learning something new and complicated that there is any one\n",
    "resource that makes it all click for me. Functional programming is a vast topic and my limited understanding of it comes\n",
    "from a variety of sources on the subject -- some of which I'll link to at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "So long as you have a basic grasp of sets and functions, you should be able to follow along."
